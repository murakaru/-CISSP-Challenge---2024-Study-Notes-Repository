## CIA Triad

**Objective** 

- What is the CIA triad? 
- Explain AAA security framework. 
- Understand other security definitions e.g authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation and assurance. 


For information about the CIA triad, [click here](https://murakaru.com/career-blog-1/f/building-secure-systems)
Opposite of CIA triad is DAD which stands for Disclosure,Alteration and Destruction. 
Other key terms described in the cyber security must know [blog](https://murakaru.com/career-blog-1/f/building-secure-systems?blogcategory=Cybersecurity+Posts+) include: Authenticity, Accountability, Non-repudiation and assurance

## Security Concepts

- Differences between vulnerability, threat, risk, exposure and control - These terms are easily glosssed over however, its imperative for security teams to undestand the differences inorder to avoid confusion. 
- Here is a pretty neat diagram I created that shows the differences and relationship between security concepts.

## Security Controls 

**Objectives**
- What are security controls 
- Explain the types of security controls 
- Explain the functionalities of the security controls 

These are put in place to reduce risks an organization might face.

**Types of Controls**
- Administrative: security documentation, risk management, personnel security, and training
- Technical: software or hardware components, as in firewalls, IDS, encryption, and identification and authentication mechanisms.
- Physical: security guards, locks, fencing, and lighting.

Controls provide **Defence in Depth** which is a layered security approach. If one line of defense is compromised, additional layers exist as a backup to ensure that threats are stopped along the way. 

**Functionalities of security controls**
- **Preventive** Intended to avoid an incident from occurring
- **Detective** Helps identify an incident’s activities and potentially an intruder
- **Corrective** Fixes components or systems after an incident has occurred
- **Deterrent** Intended to discourage a potential attacker
- **Recovery** Intended to bring the environment back to regular operations
- **Compensating** Controls that provide an alternative measure of control


## Security Control Frameworks 

**Objectives**

- What is a security Control framework?
- Why do organizations need Security control frameworks?
- Which Frameworks exist in the market.


Security control Frameworks form the foundation for security programs. By adopting Security control frameworks, organizations can apply proven security practises to their organizations. Frameworks are generic and can be used across multiple industries. 

**Common Security Control Frameworks**

1. **ISO/IEC 27000 series** - This is a joint standard for Information Security Management (ISM) 
- **ISO 27001**
Information Security Management Requirements for **governance**
Examines the risks of an organization e.g threats, vulnerabilities. 
Uses the above information to develop policies
Designs and impelements suite of information security controls (defined in 27002) to address and manage the risks. 
Ensures that security practises are followed to ensure that the security controls meet the organizations security needs on an ongoing basis
Plan -> Do -> Check ->Act.  
Measure twice and cut one. 
Example: GDPR

- **ISO 27002** - Information **Security Controls defined** to achieve your mission as an organization. The goal is to implement policies, assign responsibilities and prescribe proceedures for applying integrated, layered protection for Information Systems. 
There are 12 security controls defined 

  - Risk assesment 
  - Security policy 
  - Organization Information Security 
  - Asset Management 
  - Human Resource Security 
  - Physical and Environmental Security 
  - Communication and operational Management 
  - Access Controls 
  - Information System Acquisition, development and maintenance 
  - Information Security Incident management 
  - Business Continuity Management 
  - Compliance - Ensuring conformance 

Nb/ Note the difference between 27001 and 27002 for the CISSP exam

2. **Committee Of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO)**

  This one places an emphasis on how to identify and manage financial risks e.g Fraud prevention by     implementing a system for financial checks and balances.

3. **Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)**

  ITIL focuses on understanding how IT and security needs to be integrated with and aligned to the objectives of an organization
  A best practise document for IT service management. 

4. **PCI-DSS**

  Payment Card Data Security Standards - Provides standards that must be followed for any organization that accepts cards or any form of electronic payments. 


5. **Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT)**

  Used by auditors and planning committee 

**Elements of Cobit**
- Organization design/strategy
- People
- Processes 
- Technology 

**Dynamic Interconnection Factors**
- Governance 
- Culture 
- Enablement
- Emergence
- Human Factors
- Architecture

**PDCA - (Plan -> Do ->Check ->Act) - Cobit**

  This creates a flexible standard that sets expections for problem solving and cjhange management teams. It ensures that the organization is safe from security risks

**NIST Frameworks**

- NIST 800-53 Rev. 5
- NIST Risk Management Framework
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework

**Other Frameworks to note**

- Sherwood Applied Vusiness Security Architecture (SABSA): This is an open standard for security infrastructure development 
- Capability Maturity Model (CMMI): Software developers maturity rating 
- Six Sigma: Developed for identifying manufacturing defects but can be used to measure the success factors of security framework.

**Due Diligence vs Due Care**

So how due you disapprove **negligence** in the occurrence of a loss?  Due Diligence and Due Care. What's the difference between the two?
